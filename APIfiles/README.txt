The only files that are needed to launch the simulations are:
- Base.aedt,                             HFSS project
- Python_HFSS_interface_NoVarExport.m,   Python script that implements the API, launches the simulations, and extracts the results

All the other files are generated after launching the API.

Remark! Modify all the paths contained in the Python script according to the location of the files on your computer.
